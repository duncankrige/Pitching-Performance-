total_pairs (3,267): All valid jump height and pitch velocity pairs within the 7-day window for the 20 players common to both datasets.
jump_below_count (1,093): Times jump height (cmjheight) was below the player’s benchmark.
velocity_below_count (1,758): Times pitch velocity (velocity) was below the player’s benchmark.
both_below_count (619): Times both jump height AND velocity were below their benchmarks (your fatigue signal).
jump_below_velocity_ok (474): Times jump height was below benchmark, but velocity was at or above (fatigue but no speed drop).
jump_ok_velocity_below (1,139): Times jump height was at or above benchmark, but velocity was below (speed drop without fatigue).


Jump Below Benchmark Rate:
1,093 / 3,267 = 33.5% of pairs had a below-benchmark jump height.

Velocity Below Benchmark Rate:
1,758 / 3,267 = 53.8% of pairs had a below-benchmark velocity.

Both Below Rate:
619 / 3,267 = 18.9% of pairs had both below benchmark.

Conditional Probability (Key Question):
Of the 1,093 times jump height was below benchmark, how often was velocity also below?
619 / 1,093 = 56.6%.Compare to overall velocity below rate (53.8%)—a slight increase (2.8% higher).


Interpretation
Weak Link: When jump height is below benchmark, velocity is below benchmark 56.6% of the time—only marginally higher than the overall 53.8%. This suggests a weak connection between fatigue (low jump) and slower pitches across all players.
Mismatch Cases:
474 cases (14.5% of total): Jump below, velocity fine—fatigue might not always slow pitches (e.g., adrenaline or mechanics compensate).
1,139 cases (34.9% of total): Jump fine, velocity below—other factors (e.g., arm fatigue, pitch type) often reduce speed without jump height dropping.
Why Weak?:
7-day window might dilute daily fatigue effects.
Aggregating 20 players could hide individual trends (like we saw with correlations).
Velocity varies naturally (e.g., pitch type, game context) beyond fatigue.
