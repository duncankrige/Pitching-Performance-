We’ll join rapsodo_pitches_t2 (pitches), force_plate_data_t (power), and vald_t (strength) on player names, using a ±7-day window between tests and pitches (adjustable if sparse). 
We’ll correlate pitchspeed and totalspin with a combined metric (peak_relative_prop_power + r_max_force)

SELECT
    ROUND(CORR(r.velocity, (f.peak_rel_prop_power + v.r_max_force))::numeric, 4) AS corr_velo_power_force,
    ROUND(CORR(r.totalspin, (f.peak_rel_prop_power + v.r_max_force))::numeric, 4) AS corr_spin_power_force,
    COUNT(*) AS pair_count
FROM rapsodo_pitches_t2 AS r
