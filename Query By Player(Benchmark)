Since the overall link is weakfor the benchmark averages, I wanted test it by player to see if some show a stronger fatigue signal. 



WITH benchmarks AS (
    SELECT 
        playername AS name,
        AVG(cmjheight) AS jump_benchmark
    FROM 
        force_plate_data_t
    WHERE 
        cmjheight IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        playername
    HAVING 
        COUNT(*) > 10
), velocity_benchmarks AS (
    SELECT 
        name,
        AVG(velocity) AS velocity_benchmark
    FROM 
        rapsodo_pitches_t2
    WHERE 
        velocity IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        name
    HAVING 
        COUNT(*) > 50
), joined_data AS (
    SELECT 
        f.playername,
        f.cmjheight,
        r.velocity,
        b.jump_benchmark,
        vb.velocity_benchmark,
        CASE WHEN f.cmjheight < b.jump_benchmark THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS below_jump,
        CASE WHEN r.velocity < vb.velocity_benchmark THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS below_velocity
    FROM 
        force_plate_data_t f
    JOIN

    ON
